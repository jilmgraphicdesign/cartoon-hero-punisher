			<li>Frank Castle is The Punisher. Driven by the deaths of his wife and two children, who were killed by the mob for witnessing a killing in New York City's Central Park, the Punisher wages a one-man war on the mob and all violent criminals in general. A war veteran and a United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper, Castle is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship. Despite wanting to work alone, the Punisher has a few supporting characters to help fight crime.</li>
			<li>By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes. The character is described as obsessed with vengeance. He sees the world in very black and white terms, he solves his problems with utter finality. Castle's response to any problem: when in doubt, hit back hard. Frank seeks vengeance for the deaths of his family by punishing criminals everywhere. The Punisher skull emblem has become popular within the Blue Lives Matter movement. </li>
			<li>The Punisher is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita Sr. and Ross Andru, with publisher Stan Lee green-lighting the name. The Punisher made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #129 in 1974.
